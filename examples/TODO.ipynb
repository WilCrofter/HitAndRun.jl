    "#### A list of possibilities based on Anderson & Diaconis Hit and Run as a Unifying Device,  *Journal de la Société Française de Statistique*, 148(4):5-28, [[PDF](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/hitandrun062207.pdf)], its references, and literature search based on the references.\n",

    "* Mallow's and other models of ranking and ordering. \n",
    "    * In Mallow's model, as covered in Anderson & Diaconis, the likelihood of an unseen permutation (equivalently, an unseen ranking or ordering) depends on its correlation with observed permutations which are presumed to contain errors.\n",
    "    * [Seriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seriation_%28archaeology%29) is a related problem arising in archaeology and paleontology involving chronological ordering of sites based on the artifacts or fossils they contain. [Seriation in Paleontological Data Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020006) present an alternate likelihood appropriate to their field. they also provide organized data.\n",
    "* Weak repetitive patterns. Liu, *Monte Carlo Strategies in Scientific Computing* [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=jwrSBwAAQBAJ&dq=Monte+Carlo+Strategies+in+Scientific+Computing&lr=) (among others) describes the problem of finding DNA (or RNA or protein) subsequences most common to a given set of sequences. This problem is used in several places as an illustration for Gibbs sampling.\n",
    "* L Lovász, S Vempala, Hit and Run from a Corner, SIAM Journal on Computing, 2006 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=hit+and+run+from+a+corner&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C21&as_sdtp=) samples an exponetial distribution from the interior of a convex set.\n",
    "* Small effects: See Mengersen et. al., [Bayesian Estimation of Small Effects in Exercise and Sports Science](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147311). \"A key interest in sports science is the estimation and evaluation of small effects, such as the difference in finishing times between world-class athletes, or the impact of exercise training and/or lifestyle interventions such as dietary changes or sleep behaviors on performance.\" MCMC used to estimate posteriors of effect vs placebo. Small effects could, conceivably, be useful for individuals.\n"
